Colleagues,
 
To standardize and streamline our workflows, access to the traditional dictation method will no longer be available after  July 31, 2024.
We recognize that you need a reliable method of dictating your operative and/or consultative reports.  This alternative is Dragon, a speech recognition and dictation tool designed for use in healthcare settings.   We have waited to make this transition to ensure that Dragon was easy to use and is a viable alternative to the current transcription system.  The majority of our dictations are now done via the Dragon software.  
 
Dragon Medical Software offers several benefits:
1.	Efficiency: Dictate your notes in real-time, reducing transcription time and allowing for faster documentation.
2.	Accuracy: Dragon Medical's advanced speech recognition technology minimizes errors in patient records.
3.	Customization: Tailor the software to your unique voice and medical terminology for improved efficiency.
4.	Accessibility: Access your dictations from any device with internet connectivity, making it convenient for use in various clinical settings.
For detailed instructions on how to use the Dragon Medical Software, please click  Dragon Dictation Guide.pdf (also attached to this email). Alternatively, if you prefer personalized instruction, you may contact Rebecca Kunnes at rkunnes2@jhmi.edu or 667-208-7910 for assistance.
 
We recognize that changes, even if ultimately more efficient, can be challenging.  For this reason we have ensured access to personalized training and time for you to become familiar with this alternative dictation system.   I encourage you to try it out as soon as possible. 
 
If you have questions or difficulties with access or using Dragon please reach out to me.  Thank you for the care you provide our patients. 
Carrie
