# Lets Release a Plugin For Clinicians & Public Health Specialists

> The only input it requires is from a `.csv` file: de-identified data points (base-case function), weights (variance-covariance matrix), and parameters (beta-coefficient vector). This framework explicitly outlines `a footprint of available and missing data`, which can be replaced with defaults from a known distribution.A clinician or end-user may guided by an AI-assistant into building an _a priori_. Appropriately for a `plugin`, this input represents `universal algebra`, independent of Python, AI, R, Stata

The main differences between a plugin and an app are:

1. Functionality:
   - A plugin is an add-on that extends or enhances the functionality of an existing application or platform.
   - An app (application) is a standalone software program designed to perform specific tasks or functions independently.

2. Dependency:
   - Plugins are dependent on a host application to run and cannot function on their own.
   - Apps are self-contained and can run independently without relying on other software.

3. Integration:
   - Plugins integrate into existing software, often seamlessly, to add new features or capabilities.
   - Apps operate as separate entities and don't necessarily integrate with other software unless designed to do so.

4. Scope:
   - Plugins typically have a focused purpose, addressing specific needs within a larger application.
   - Apps can have a broader scope, offering a wide range of features and functionalities.

5. Installation:
   - Plugins are usually installed within the host application or platform.
   - Apps are installed directly on the operating system or device.

6. User interface:
   - Plugins often adopt the user interface of the host application.
   - Apps have their own distinct user interfaces.

For example, a browser extension is a type of plugin that adds functionality to a web browser, while a word processing program is a standalone app.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of plugins or apps?
